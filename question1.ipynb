He was aware of that most french people don\\'t speak english so he ordered a french lesson for one day to learn the necessities when going to a new country. The day for the lesson came, but when he arrived at the school, it seemed quite empty. He went in saw a guy sitting behind a counter. \"Hi, I came for the french lesson today\" our guy said. \"Oh, I\\'m sorry. The French teacher is ill and will be home for a week.\" \"So there is no one that know any french here?\" \"No I\\'m sorry. But I have a little note I can give you. Just show it when you order something, or don\\'t know what to say, and it should work out fine\" \"Uhm ok. What does it say?\" \"I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t know, really. The french teacher just told me to give it to people while he was gone.\" Our guy thought that was fair enough. He didn\\'t have time to order a new lesson anyway.  The day for the journey came. With a packed bag he went to the airport and flew all the way to France. He arrived in France in the evening and went out to grab a cab. A cab arrived and after greeting the French cab driver he figured he could use the note and see if the driver would understand what it said. He showed the note. The driver looked at the note, then at our guy, then at the note, and back at the guy, before he cursed in french and drove off. \"Well that\\'s weird. Maybe the note isn\\'t ment for cab drivers\" he thought and walked until he found a bus. He went on the bus and thought he\\'d give the note another try. The bus driver looked at the note and went red in an instant. He commanded our guy off the bus, and drove away. This annoyed our guy a little. He waited for another bus and did not show the note this time. He said the name of his hotel, the bus driver nodded, he paid and sat down next to a lady. She asked him in french if he was american and he said yes. She seemed to understand a little english, so he thought she could translate the note. He asked if she could and she nodded. He pulled out the note and showed it to her. She read it and quickly shoved it away from her in anger, and she called for the bus driver. Our guy understood what they wanted and stood the rest of the ride in frustration. He finally arrived at his hotel tired of being yelled at and ready to sleep. At the receptions desk he told his name, they wrote something down and asked him for ID. When finding his ID the note accidentally fell out of his pocket and onto the counter. The receptionist read it and as he expected, got really mad. Another guy that worked there came and they talked for a while, before accepting that our guy could sleep there, but they weren\\'t happy about it.  \"That\\'s it. I\\'ve had enough of this, tomorrow I\\'m going back home!\" our guy thought, and so he did.  Luckily this was easier. He did not show the note to anyone and mimed his way back to America. He stayed home for a week before deciding to go back to the french school, now that the teacher was back, and find out what the note said. At the school he met the teacher and asked quite annoyed what the note said. \"Let me see\" the teacher said putting on his glasses. Our guy handed him the note. At this time two windows were open. A gust of wind blew the note out of their hands and out one of the windows, and they never found it. Neither did our guy find out what the note said... Not even I know... Sorry <|endofjoke|>'},\n",

There was nothing noteworthy about the first two hours, but it was as if we’d entered a strange new world once we’d left the interstate highways to proceed on farm roads with odd names and/or numbers. No other cars.   These paved roads appeared well-worn, but it was unfamiliar!  There were barbed wire fences on both sides of this two lane road and random horses and cows.      Then, suddenly, there was a blur that burst past the side of our car.  What was that?!  We both uttered these words, simultaneously.    We decided to find out.     I was driving 60mph, so I sped up to 70mph.   I was gaining on the blur, but it was clear I needed to go faster if I had any hope to identify this freakishly speedy blur.  I accelerated to 80mph but it seemed to be moving much faster.   Just as I exceeded 90mph I realized I’d never match it’s speed.  But suddenly the blur made a right turn onto an humble dirt road.    I screeched to a halt.  My buddy said, ‘you gotta turn around and try to see what that thing was!!’  I was curious, as well, so that’s precisely what I did.  I cautiously proceeded down this dirt road and it was less than 1/2mile when we noticed a broken down wooden shack of a home.   On the porch were three folks in rocking chairs.  I parked my car and stepped out, politely announcing my name and asking if these folks had seen this blur that had us so perplexed!  “Oh, yeah”, responded the old lady.   “That was one of our three legged chickens.”  My buddy reacted, “three legged chickens?”  She continued, “well, me, Paw and Jr. all LOVE chicken legs.  It was Jr’s idea.   He said we needed to raise three legged chickens!  And that’s what we did!  That blur---you seen one of em!’    Jr’s beeming  pride was obvious as he smiled a smile so incredible it exposed his dozen remaining teeth!!  The American Dental Association would have been bewildered, speechless!  “Sounds like a great idea!”, I said.  I continued, “So…..how do they taste?”  Jr’s smile evaporated as Maw responded, “don’t know.   Can’t catch ‘em.” <|endofjoke|>'},\n",

Unlike anything which can be found anywhere else in the world. Afterwards there was a celebration for the Torero (Bullfighter) and the crowd slowly dispersed, with the man leaving among the last of them so that he could savor the experience.   Once he'd exited the arena, he noticed large groups from the group gathering at a restaurant across the street. Hungry, the man followed as well and decided to experience the native cuisine.   As the night progressed, he had joined a few others at a table and began chatting with them joyously about the match. Until he noticed that at one table a very wealthy looking man had been made the center of attention by the restaurants staff as the chef personally brought out a special silver plate with strange meat on them.  Curious, the man asked his new friends what was so special about that man. One of the men at his table explained that the man was a foreigner, much like him, who has payed handsomely for the privilege of eating the spirit of the bull which died in the arena. Which according to them was symbolically located in the testicles of the powerful animal.   Obviously amazed by the ritual, he noticed how excited & happy the man was. Being quite wealthy himself, he asked if there was any way for him to pay for the same honor. After a short talk with the restaurants owner, he came to an agreement and reserved a plate for tomorrow.  Though he didn't get a chance to watch the bullfights that day, he had anxiously been waiting since the previous night for this moment. And now that he was at the restaurant he couldn't help but rush to his table and wait for his meal.  After a few moments, the staff gathered and the chef brought out the same plate as the previous night, except that there was noticeably less meat on it this time.  Confused, the man asked the chef if the bull had been smaller than the one from yesterday.  The chef merely replied that the bull is quite large, alive, and in good health, it was the Torero who lost today. <|endofjoke|>\"},\n",

MODERN VERSION:   The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he\\'s a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.   Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.   CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?   Then a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with \"green bias,\" and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism.   Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings \"It\\'s Not Easy Being Green.\" Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the \"Temperatures of the 80\\'s.\"  Richard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his \"fair share.\" Finally, the EEOC drafts the \"Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act\" retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government.   Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday\\'s between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled.   The ant loses the case.   The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant\\'s food while the government house he\\'s in, which just happens to be the ant\\'s old house, crumbles around him since he doesn\\'t know how to maintain it.   The ant has disappeared in the snow.

The contest is officially scheduled for Easter Sunday, and news spreads far and wide.   Easter Sunday rolls around. People from all over flock to Heaven to witness the contest. It is broadcasted live on several news stations, and is even live-tweeted by some representatives from Google. At exactly 8:59 AM, Satan and Jesus both sit down at two computers, facing each other. They log in and open up their scripting program. At 9 AM, Archangel Michael drops a flag and the race begins.   One hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it\\'s a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead.   By 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus.   By noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately.   At 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming.   By 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can\\'t be perfectly formatted.   2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces \"JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!\"   Satan is furious. \"How can this be?\" He asks. \"I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!\"  Jesus taunts Satan. \"Well I don\\'t see your code, Satan. It must have been lost when the computers were shut off.\"  \"Your computer was shut off, too!\" Satan retorts. \"I guess neither of us win!\"   God, rather proud of his son at this point, walks over and turns back on both computers. Predictably, Satan\\'s coding cannot be found, but when Jesus\\'s computer is booted back up, his program is right there on the desktop. God opens it, and it runs like a charm.   \"How can this be?\" Satan snarls. \"I finished more coding! It should be there! I should\\'ve won this!\"   \"Satan, my friend,\" God says, \"You have made a grave mistake. See, you may code faster, and perhaps even better than my son, but Jesus...   Jesus saves.\" <|endofjoke|>'},\n",

It may be the toxic fumes or perhaps some unfinished business being triggered from my relationship with my father… And of course there a really warm sensation in my ass and that’s really interesting because….”  Satan cuts off this rambling speech and signals for the demons to drag him away too with a wave of his hand, a weary sigh and an exasperated look. Finally he moves on the CBT practitioner and stands over him and trying to look as scary as he can.  Again he asks “Welcome to hell mortal. How does it feel to know you are now a slave in my kingdom for all eternity?”  The CBT practitioner knows that it doesn’t matter what happens to him, it’s all about how he reacts to things. He may have died, awoken in hell and seen his two friends dragged away by demons but so long as he can maintain positive thoughts then not even these things can upset him.

The son explained the situation to the lady and told her that even though he has no money, he does have this duck. The woman thinks for a while, and decides to take the duck as payment since she knew a guy that could help her prepare the duck so that she could cook it for dinner.  So after they have sex, the woman is flabbergasted at just how magnificent the son was in bed. She even offered him a freebie but being the polite guy that he is, he refused. So the woman, desperate for another round, offered the duck back as payment, the son agrees and so they have sex again.  Later, the son leaves the brothel with the duck. On their way back home a truck appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and hits the duck, killing it. Feeling bad, the driver offers to pay the son for the duck. Not knowing how much it was worth the son settles for $20. The driver happily obliges, pays him the $20, and they both go on their ways.  Finally the son gets home when his dad asks him \"So son, how was it?\" The son replies \"I dunno dad, you tell me.\" \"Ok, so tell me what happened\" replied the dad. The son replied \"Well dad, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 20 bucks for a fucked up duck.\" <|endofjoke|>'},\n",

       " {'joke': 'Friends, DON\\'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR! <|sep|> I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.  No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans (look it up) were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can\\'t-Be-Flushed threshold.  I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. \"Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don\\'t I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!\" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. \"How many Indians could there be?\" said by General Custer. \"Looks like a good day for a drive!\" by JFK. \"There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!\" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.  I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.  Little did I know.  I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.  Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit-molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.  Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: \"It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.\"  Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.  As if that wasn\\'t enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn\\'t just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.

       " {'joke': 'A Catholic Priest finds a job. <|sep|> Dave the Catholic Priest needed a part time job. His salary was still quite low and he needed to save up while on vacation. So he got in contact with Francis, the Bishop, to get help in spreading word around local businesses that Dave was a good, honest chap ready to undertake work.    In no time at all Dave got a break- fast food.     He showed up at 7 am for the first day. Jim, an old friend of Francis the Bishop, was sympathetic to Dave\\'s cause and was happy in giving him a dozen hours a week. He was also aware of Dave\\'s one flaw that Francis warned him about: Dave tended to daydream and become forgetful, aloof or even careless during monotonous tasks. This had led to him losing the Church keys on a few occasions. Leading Choir practice in the driving rain was not a pleasant experience.   So Jim was on the lookout and intended to keep a keen eye on Dave\\'s performance.     \"Dave mate. I haven\\'t trained you in food safety yet. So for this week you\\'re responsible for keeping the joint clean before, during, and after the chippy is open for service. Right. Any questions? Good man,\"    So Dave was handed reign of all cleaning supplies and tasks. Days 1 and 2 went okay. Dave just about managed to prep the front of shop for the opening, though struggled keeping count of all the bits and bobs in inventory. Day 3 was a struggle. Dave, used to working in leisurely pace found wiping down tables and clearing trash in time quite taxing. More than once he left spray bottles around benches and behind doors. Customers were befuddled and Jim left frustrated at this incompetence.    Jim stopped Dave on the morning of day 4. Trash was found under tables, counters left too greasy after ineffective wiping, and the supplies were whittled away almost to nothing but a sponge after Dave\\'s mismanagement.    \"Jim, look I\\'m really sorry. But I\\'m getting the hang of this now! Please give me another role if you really don\\'t me cleaning.\"    So Jim complied. The next day Dave turned up at 6.30 am as per instruction.    \"Okay Dave. Fresh start. This job is a bit new and I\\'m sure you\\'ll learn from it too. You need to collect the frozen supplies at the store. They\\'ve been paid for so don\\'t worry. Just collect everything and race back in good time. If you know what I mean.\"    Dave thought he knew exactly what Jim meant.     \"So long as I drive quickly, I can take the rest of the day off!\"    Two hours later on what should have been a 15 minute trip, Dave entered the premises with a dejected expression.    Ten minutes later Jim also wore the same expression, albeit with a scowl and high blood pressure to match; Dave had struck a streetlamp, mounted the sidewalk and blown out a tire in the process because he thought Jim wanted him to *race* back. With the company car out of service Jim was strained to keep things operational. Dave was becoming a liability.    To the sheepish priest he said, \"Dave. Final chance. I hired you as a favor, not a burden. From tomorrow work in the back with Phil on food. He\\'ll give you something to do.\"    Dave nodded vigorously, \"Thank you so much Jim! I swear to it- I won\\'t be forgetful or careless. You can count on me!\"    \"Yeah. Good. Just don\\'t burn this place down.\"    6.30 am, the next day. Dozens of customers filed in and out every few hours, bellies filled, vinegary lips smacked. Jim didn\\'t see much of Dave. Naturally he was quite nervous. No complaints over the phone for mixed up orders, or hair in the mayo, or dismembered digits in the salad. Maybe he should have put Dave there in the first place. The next day came and went. Another suspiciously uneventful day. Almost too quiet. \"Don\\'t fret too much\", Jim thought to himself later on that Thursday evening. \"Phil was happy with Dave\\'s work and didn\\'t mention any hiccups.\"    A week passed in this way. Jim was in a good mood to say the least. Sales and profit had nearly increased by 500%; customers were actually leaving feedback on their experience for the first time in months; The company car was back from repairs, costs much lower than anticipated; the takeaway was still not destroyed in a fire, and Phil reported no missing items or mishap in the kitchen. Even Dave was in a good mood, starting and leaving his shifts with a smile on his face and lively spring in his step, giving him an almost surreptitious look.      It was nearing the end of Dave\\'s vacation. Jim had just handed the last overtime paycheck to his star employee when he thought to ask something on his mind for a while now, \"Dave, top job. You\\'ve done wonders to help this takeaway get back on its feet again. Everyone loves the food. Heck, even people from the next town over are calling in to order! So between us two men- how on earth do you cook so well? The battered fish is the talk of the town, so are the chicken wings- oh and the chips! They\\'re so good they make you want to slap your mama! How have you done it!?\"    \"It\\'s nothing, really Jim!\"    \"No, no! Please tell! You\\'re one of us. Even if you\\'re leaving, you can pop around to help any time you want at double your current wages. But please. How have you done it?\"    \"It\\'s simple, Jim,\" Dave said as he moved to lean forward, closing the gap between his boss. Involuntarily, an excited croak left Jim\\'s throat.    \"Oh?\" sweat beaded on his forehead.     \"Simple, Jim. I\\'m just a good friar.\" <|endofjoke|>'},\n",
